  installed package clock 1.0.3, installed using Python 3.12.5

Additionally, you can configure a shortcut to run the app from your Start Menu without opening a
Terminal first. To do so, create a shortcut named `Clock Overlay` in the
`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` directory. Point it to the following target:
`pwsh.exe -w hidden -c clock-overlay`. You can use [this asset](./clock/assets/icon.ico) as icon.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) installed, use `powershell.exe` instead.

You can now run the app from your Start Menu using `Clock Overlay`.

You can move the window by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse. To reset the window to
its origin position, press the right mouse button. Press the middle mouse button to quit.
